    "Founded in 2025, the Data Science Club at ELTE is a beginner-friendly community where students learn together through hands-on projects, guest talks, and collaborative exploration of data science, AI, and machine learning.",
    "Our approach is community-first: we learn together rather than teaching from above. We focus on showcases, teamwork, and real projects that give members portfolio evidence through GitHub contributions. Everyone contributes at their own level while building a stronger community."
